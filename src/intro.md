# HNRS251 - Social Computing

Welcome to the Social Computing class!

This is a course that will involve two areas of knowledge: social sciences and computer science. In the following weeks we will wrestle with models of reality, providing understanding and challenges about humans and societies. Using Lewis Smedes standpoint on models, in our fallen world, we are meant to create some imperfect models of the good world that will one day come about {cite}`smedes2003my`. And that's what we will try to do.

This will be a hands-on course, where we will learn by doing. As we do, we will also reflect and learn important concepts and ideas that will nurture our understanding of the world and our place in it.

Prof. Jonathan Hill and Prof. Eric Ara√∫jo will be your guides in this journey.
