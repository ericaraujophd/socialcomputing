# Programming in NetLogo

This guide follows the same structure as the [NetLogo documentation](https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/docs/), but it is tailored to our course. It is not a replacement for the official documentation, but rather a complement to it. We own all the credit for this material to Ury Wilensky and the Center for Connected Learning and Computer-Based Modeling at Northwestern University {cite}`wilensky1999netlogo`. The official documentation is a great resource, and we encourage you to use it as well.

In this tutorial, we intend to provide the basic concepts and programming skills necessary to start programming in NetLogo. This tutorial is focused on programming. Come back to this part whenever you need to refresh your memory on the basic concepts of programming in NetLogo.
